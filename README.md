A utility Python package designed to download data from Hall of Fame voting data from [baseball-reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/).
The tool is designed to download and return the data as a `pd.Dataframe` object so it can be used in other Python projects.
This is not a full-fledged supported tool that will be regularly maintained.
Just needed to create a tool with this functionality and figured that I would make it into a Python package.
